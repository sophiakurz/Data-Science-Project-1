# Astrology
My purpose of this study was because I wanted to prove three hypotheses that I had: that Virgo's are, on average, the most studious sign, that students who are enrolled in McCombs and the STEM colleges are the least believing in astrology, and that students enrolled in COLA were more believing.

Known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection - reporting biases in the students I was collecting data from. What's more, I didn't talk to an equal amount of people from each college or sign, so the data may not be 100% reflective of what I was trying to find.

I am conducting this experiment for purely entertainment purposes, and because I think that there might be something to be said about correlations we can draw from the findings.

In my findings, I am showing average studying times of each sign as well as how much students in each college believe in astrology.
